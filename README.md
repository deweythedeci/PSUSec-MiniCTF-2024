## Problems

### **where_am_i**  
Can you figure out the location of this image?
For this problem, give the street address of the Citgo shown.

---

### **decode_me**  
I have this flag for you, but it looks like it got encoded somehow. Sorry!

---

### **not_a_png**  
For some reason, I can't seem to open this PNG file. Can you help me?

---

### **strings_in_a_haystack**  
I have a program for you to see if your flag is correct.
Oh. You don't have the flag yet? Oh well...

---

### **pwn_me**  
This super secure program has the flag apparently, but it won't let me see it!
