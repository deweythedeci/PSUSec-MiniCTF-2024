The flag format is `flag{...}`.

## Problems

### **decode_me**  
I have this flag for you, but I dropped it and it feel through a few encoding schemes. Sorry!

---

### **decrypt_me**  
You have the flag but no way to decrypt it! Luckily, you do have the tool that was used to encrypt it.

---

### **in_fine_print**  
Supposedly, this image has a flag in it, but I can't find it. Where could it be?

---

### **not_a_png**  
For some reason, I can't seem to open this PNG file. Can you help me?

---

### **pwn_me**  
This super secure program has the flag apparently, but it won't let me see it!

---

### **rev_me**
This Python script can tell me if I have the correct flag or not. Maybe you can piece it together?

---

### **strings_in_a_haystack**  
I have a program for you to see if your flag is correct.  
Oh. You don't have the flag yet? Oh well...

---

### **where_am_i**  
Can you figure out the location of this image?  
Give you answer as coordinates as in the following `flag{XX.XXX,XX.XXX}`
